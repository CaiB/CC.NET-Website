# ColorChord.NET Website

This is where the [ColorChord.NET](https://www.colorchord.net) website is generated and hosted from.

Based on the [Doks](https://getdoks.org/) Hugo theme.

How to make it go:
- Install the Extended version of Hugo: [Installation Instructions](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/), ideally add the install dir to your PATH.
- Install NPM
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run start`

This is using an older version of Doks from [this point in time](https://github.com/gethyas/doks/tree/cf51ea887dd12f79588f950988d0eb6c6895407f), because I can't be bothered to keep re-doing all of my changes and completely relearning new tools every few months when web devs decide to pull the rug out from under me.
